# Quadratic-root-finder
A simple C++ code to find roots of quadratic equation. Shows the real roots of equation and otherwise notifies user that equation has one/no root.

# Working

- It prompt user to input the 3 coefficients of equation (a,b,c)
- Then it confirm that the equation is correct by putting it in a general equation
- Next, user needs to input yes/no using Y/N. This is checked using a if-else statement
- Once the equation is confirmed, A function is called to find the discriminant.
- If the discriminant is more than 0, we proceed to finding the negative and positive roots.
- Otherwise, it will say that the equation only have one root/no roots

# Running

- Basic libraries are needed, but its there with most IDE's.
- To run this code, you need a C++ compiler installed in pc.
- Can be run in android/ios, but a proper ide/app is needed to run.
- Alternatively, people can use web IDE for this purpose.
